# Spotify-Inspired Homepage Redesign

**Date:** 2026-03-13
**Status:** Design Approved
**Scope:** Homepage rewrite — single-page app shell with typographic project index, Now Playing panel, and media player bar

---

## 1. Overview

Replace the current homepage (HeroToGridSection / ProjectListView toggle) with a Spotify Desktop-inspired single-page app shell. The gallery IS the homepage — no separate landing page. The preloader fades directly into the gallery.

**References:**
- [ethanandtom.com](https://www.ethanandtom.com/) — Index/Selects typographic toggle, video thumbnails in rows
- Spotify Desktop — Now Playing side panel, playlist library layout, bottom media player bar

**Core metaphor:** The portfolio is a playlist. Projects are tracks. The Now Playing panel shows what's selected. The player bar controls navigation.

---

## 2. Architecture: Single-Page App Shell

The homepage is a persistent layout with three zones. Views swap via AnimatePresence — no page routing between Index/Selects/Info.

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  GlobalNav  [HKJ]   Index  Selects  Info    [=]  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                                    |              |
|   Main Content Area                | Now Playing  |
|   (Index / Selects / Info)         | Panel        |
|                                    | (380px)      |
|                                    |              |
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  >  |<  >|   Project Title         ===*=====  2/4|
|            Player Bar (56px fixed bottom)         |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

**No routing between views.** Index, Selects, and Info are component swaps within the same page. The panel and player bar are persistent chrome.

---

## 3. Hero Section

A typographic identity block at the top of the Index and Selects views.

```

                    portfolio v2.0
                    4 projects loaded
                    2 in development
```

- Mono typography, centered, generous letter-spacing, lowercase body lines
- Grid background (existing `grid-lines` utility)
- Height: ~40vh
- "4 projects loaded / 2 in development" is a live count derived from `PROJECTS` array length and ghost count
- Entrance: GSAP stagger on each line after preloader completes (existing pattern)

---

## 4. Index View (Default)

Single-column typographic list. Each row represents a project.

### Row layout

```
| [01]  SIFT: DIGITAL SANCTUARY                    |
|       Mobile . AI -- 2025                         |
|----------------------------------------------------|
```

- Full-width rows, ~80-100px height, 1px hairline dividers between rows
- Number: mono `[01]`, dim
- Title: display font, uppercase
- Meta: `sector -- year`, mono, dim
- Hover: background shifts to `rgba(0,0,0,0.03)`, 1px left accent border appears, cursor changes to "project" context
- Click: opens Now Playing panel + sets player bar active project

### Ghost rows

Two ghost rows at positions 5 and 6:

```
| [05]  ################                            |
|       ??? -- 2026                                  |
|       in development                               |
|----------------------------------------------------|
| [06]  ####################                         |
|       ??? -- 20??                                   |
|       maybe the idea will come soon                |
|----------------------------------------------------|
```

- Title: Unicode block characters (randomized width), dim opacity
- Sector: `???` mono
- Year: `2026` / `20??`
- Tagline: italic, dim, unique per ghost
- No click handler, no hover state, no cursor context change
- Player bar skips ghosts when using prev/next

---

## 5. Selects View

Same rows as Index with a thumbnail column added.

### Thumbnail specs

- Size: 160x100px (16:10 aspect), overflow hidden, 2px border-radius
- Position: left of title text
- Static projects: hero image, grayscale-to-color on row hover
- Projects with videos: first video clip, muted autoplay loop
- Video focus rule: only the video closest to viewport center plays (IntersectionObserver, `rootMargin: "-40% 0px -40% 0px"`); others show poster frame
- Ghost rows: 160x100 rectangle with CSS noise grain texture
- Row height increases to ~120-140px to accommodate thumbnails

### Index-to-Selects transition

- Thumbnail column slides in from left (translateX -40px to 0, staggered per row)
- Row height animates from ~80px to ~120px
- Text content stays in place

---

## 6. Info View

Replaces the current AboutOverlay. Renders inline in the main content area when "Info" is selected in nav.

- Editorial layout: serif italic headline, capabilities list, contact info
- Reuses content from current AboutOverlay + ContactOverlay
- Same warm typographic gallery aesthetic
- No panel interaction in this mode
- ContactOverlay remains accessible from Info view as a link/CTA

---

## 7. Now Playing Panel

Side panel that shows project summary when a row is clicked.

### Content (maps to Project interface)

```

- Width: 380px
- 1px left border (no shadow)
- Background: same as page bg
- Close: minimal X top-right, mono
- Typography: spec table uses mono labels + sans values

### Responsive behavior

| Breakpoint | Panel behavior |
|---|---|
| >= 1280px | Push main content left, 380px panel |
| 1024-1279px | Overlay with backdrop dim, 380px |
| 768-1023px | Bottom sheet, 60vh height |
| < 768px | Navigate directly to `/work/[slug]` |

### Interaction model

- Click row: opens panel with that project (or closes if same row clicked again)
- Click different row while panel open: crossfade panel content (AnimatePresence mode="wait")
- Click outside (overlay/sheet modes): closes panel
- "View Case Study" link: navigates to `/work/[slug]`

---

## 8. Player Bar

Fixed bottom media control bar. Part of the app shell chrome.

### Layout

```
+------------------------------------------------------+
|  >  |<  >|    SIFT: DIGITAL SANCTUARY    ====*====   |
|              Mobile . AI -- 2025            2 / 4     |
+------------------------------------------------------+
```

- Height: 56px desktop, 48px mobile
- Background: 1px top border separating from content
- Left zone: play/pause (toggles all video autoplay globally), prev/next skip buttons
- Center zone: active project title (display) + sector/year (mono, dim)
- Right zone: progress indicator "2 / 4" (mono), thin accent progress line at top of bar
- Page content needs `padding-bottom: 56px` to prevent overlap

### Visibility

- Hidden on initial page load
- Slides up (translateY 100% to 0, 400ms, power3.out) on first row click
- Stays visible for the rest of the session

### Skip behavior

- Next/prev cycles through real projects only (skips ghosts)
- Sets `activeProject` in store, updates panel if open
- Scrolls active row into view via Lenis `scrollTo(targetRow, { offset: -100, duration: 1.2 })`
- Wraps: after last project, goes to first

### Mobile

- Simplified: play/pause icon + truncated title + "2/4" counter
- No skip buttons (tap rows directly)

---

## 9. Preloader (Rewrite)

The current StudioPreloader (image cycling box -> viewport fill) is replaced with a typographic preloader that sets the tone for the index page.

### Behavior

Full-viewport overlay (z-1000), page background color. Three-phase state machine:

**Phase 1 — Loading** (~2-3s, or until fonts loaded):
```
    hkj
    ━━━━━━━━━●━━━━━━━━  72%
    loading...
```
- Centered mono text block, lowercase
- Accent-colored progress bar animates left to right
- Percentage counter increments (driven by `document.fonts.ready` + minimum duration)
- Grid background (existing `grid-lines` utility)

**Phase 2 — Ready** (~400ms hold):
```
    hkj
    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  100%
    ready
```
- Progress hits 100%, "loading..." swaps to "ready"
- Brief hold before exit

**Phase 3 — Exit** (300ms):
- Preloader opacity fades to 0
- Sets `isLoaded = true` in store
- Hero lines entrance via GSAP stagger begins (600ms, stagger 0.08)

### Completion triggers
- `document.fonts.ready` resolves, OR
- 4s timeout fallback (same as current preloader)
- Minimum display time: 2s (prevents flash on fast connections)

### Post-preloader state
- Player bar hidden until first interaction
- Panel closed
- Index view visible with hero section

---

## 10. Nav Integration

### Desktop GlobalNav

Add `Index | Selects | Info` links to the existing nav bar. These function as view switchers (not route links). **Keep existing nav typography and style** — view links integrate into the current design, not override it.

- Active view has underline indicator (existing spring underline pattern)
- Clicking active view is a no-op
- Links use `setActiveView()` from store

### Mobile Menu

Index/Selects/Info links added to the existing MobileMenu as numbered menu items. Clicking sets the active view and closes the menu.

---

## 11. Animation Specs

| Transition | Type | Duration | Easing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Index to/from Selects | Thumbnail slide in/out + row height | 400ms | power3.inOut |
| Index/Selects to/from Info | AnimatePresence crossfade (opacity + y:20) | 500ms | [0.16, 1, 0.3, 1] |
| Panel open | translateX(100% to 0) + main content width shrink | 500ms | power3.out |
| Panel close | Reverse of open | 400ms | power3.in |
| Panel content swap | AnimatePresence mode="wait", opacity crossfade | 300ms | linear |
| Player bar entrance | translateY(100% to 0) | 400ms | power3.out |
| Row hover | background-color transition | 200ms | ease |
| Preloader to gallery | opacity 1 to 0 | 300ms | ease |
| Hero lines entrance | GSAP stagger, y:20 to 0, opacity | 600ms stagger 0.08 | power3.out |

---

## 12. Lenis Integration

- Panel push: when panel opens/closes, main content width animates. Call `lenis.resize()` after transition completes (500ms timeout or `onTransitionEnd`)
- Player bar: fixed position, does not affect scroll height. Page content uses `padding-bottom: 56px`
- Skip/scroll: player bar prev/next uses `lenis.scrollTo()` to smoothly scroll the active row into view

---

## 13. State Management

Additions to the Zustand store (`src/lib/store.ts`):

```typescript
activeView: "index" | "selects" | "info"
setActiveView: (view: "index" | "selects" | "info") => void
activeProject: string | null          // project id for panel + player
setActiveProject: (id: string | null) => void
isPanelOpen: boolean
setIsPanelOpen: (open: boolean) => void
isPlaying: boolean                    // global video play/pause state
togglePlayback: () => void
playerVisible: boolean                // player bar has been revealed
setPlayerVisible: (v: boolean) => void
```

Existing state that can be removed:
- `viewMode` (replaced by `activeView`)
- `gridRevealed` (no longer needed without HeroToGridSection)

---

## 14. Component Breakdown

### New components

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `AppShell.tsx` | Layout wrapper: nav, main area, panel slot, player bar slot. Handles panel push/overlay logic per breakpoint. |
| `ProjectIndex.tsx` | Index view: hero block + typographic list of ProjectRow/GhostRow components |
| `ProjectSelects.tsx` | Selects view: hero block + rows with video/image thumbnails |
| `InfoView.tsx` | Inline about + contact content (replaces AboutOverlay) |
| `NowPlayingPanel.tsx` | Side panel with project specs and "View Case Study" link |
| `PlayerBar.tsx` | Fixed bottom bar: play/pause, prev/next, project info, progress |
| `ProjectRow.tsx` | Shared row component used by both Index and Selects. Props control whether thumbnail is shown. |
| `GhostRow.tsx` | Redacted "in development" row. No interactivity. |

### Modified components

| Component | Changes |
|---|---|
| `GlobalNav.tsx` | Add Index/Selects/Info view links with active underline |
| `MobileMenu.tsx` | Add view links as numbered menu items |
| `store.ts` | Add new state (activeView, activeProject, isPanelOpen, isPlaying, playerVisible). Remove viewMode, gridRevealed. |
| `page.tsx` | Rewrite to render AppShell |
| `StudioPreloader.tsx` | Rewrite to typographic preloader (text-based, no image cycling) |

### Archived/removed

| Component | Action | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `HeroToGridSection.tsx` | Archive | Replaced by ProjectIndex |
| `ProjectGridView.tsx` | Archive | Already reference-only |
| `ViewModeToggle.tsx` | Remove | Replaced by nav links |
| `AboutOverlay.tsx` | Remove | Replaced by InfoView |

### Unchanged

Cursor, ContactOverlay, TransitionOverlay, SmoothScroll, all case study components, all hooks, all constants, globals.css, ProjectListView (archived as reference).

## 15. Mobile Responsive Summary

| Breakpoint | Nav | Content | Panel | Player Bar |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| >= 1280px | Full bar + view links | Full width (pushed when panel open) | 380px push | Full controls |
| 1024-1279px | Full bar + view links | Full width | 380px overlay + dim | Full controls |
| 768-1023px | Hamburger + mobile menu | Full width | Bottom sheet 60vh | Simplified |
| < 768px | Hamburger + mobile menu | Single column | Navigate to /work/[slug] | Icon + title + counter |

---

## 16. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Panel push + Lenis scroll conflict | Call `lenis.resize()` after panel transition completes |
| Multiple simultaneous video playback | Single-focus-video: only viewport-center video plays |
| Vertical emptiness (7 rows only ~490px) | ~40vh hero section provides visual weight |
| Player bar overlapping footer content | `padding-bottom: 56px` on page content when bar is visible |
| Mobile bottom sheet + player bar overlap | Bottom sheet sits above player bar (higher z-index) |

---

## 17. Implementation Notes

These are clarifications surfaced during spec review:

- **Navigation constants:** `src/constants/navigation.ts` needs updating. The `NAV_LINKS` array and `NavLink` interface must support view-switching (Index/Selects/Info) alongside the existing overlay pattern (ContactOverlay). Plan this as part of the GlobalNav modification.
- **activeOverlay + activeView interaction:** When the user is on InfoView and opens ContactOverlay, `activeView` stays `"info"` and `activeOverlay` becomes `"contact"`. The existing overlay system supports this without changes.
- **Footer CTA removal:** The current "LET'S work together" footer CTA section is removed. Contact flow moves to InfoView (which links to ContactOverlay).
- **activeSection cleanup:** The existing `activeSection` store field may become dead code. Audit during implementation and remove if unused.
