# HKJ Studio — Resonance Surface Design Spec

> A cold monolith with one warm breath — monospace structure, mineral surface, a single living frequency line.

---

## Context

The portfolio for HKJ (Hyeon Jun / Ryan Jun), a design engineer positioning as creative director. The site must prove directorial taste — not showcase work in a template, but demonstrate compositional craft through every spatial relationship, typographic decision, and interaction timing.

**Design DNA:** Wuthering Waves' principle that theme IS ontology. The resonance concept isn't decorative — it's the singular interactive thread that runs through every page. Everything else is editorial restraint.

**Supersedes:** This spec replaces both `RYKJUN-PROJECT-FRAMEWORK.md` (gallery-wall grid concept) and `HKJ-FRAMEWORK.md` (text-list with hover covers). The editorial scroll with resonance layer is the new direction. Those framework files should be updated or archived after implementation.

## Design Principles

1. **Composition, not components.** No nav bars, hero sections, or footers. Spatial relationships between elements at extreme scale contrast.
2. **One living element.** The waveform line carries the entire resonance concept. Nothing else animates at rest. Restraint makes the one moving thing powerful.
3. **Ink on mineral.** Cool ground color (concrete, not paper). One ink at seven opacity stops. Project accent colors appear ONLY in the waveform and margin images — compression-and-release.
4. **The grid is left-shifted.** Content column sits left of center (~8vw offset), activating the right margin as compositional negative space. A vertical structural line marks the column edge.
5. **Monospace is the primary voice.** Fragment Mono at scale IS the brutalist statement. Newsreader drops to accent role — only philosophy/paradox lines. The system font carries the architecture.
6. **Exposed structure.** Grid lines, column markers, dividers are visible, not hidden. The structure is honest — like exposed concrete in brutalist architecture.
7. **Consistent system, precise deviations.** All projects share one typographic structure. Images breaking the column grid are the ONLY deviations. Deviations are loud because the system is strict.

## Color

```css
--surface: #f0f0ed;           /* mineral — cooler, concrete-like, not warm paper */
--ink-full:      rgba(35, 32, 28, 1.00);
--ink-primary:   rgba(35, 32, 28, 0.82);
--ink-secondary: rgba(35, 32, 28, 0.52);
--ink-muted:     rgba(35, 32, 28, 0.35);
--ink-faint:     rgba(35, 32, 28, 0.20);
--ink-ghost:     rgba(35, 32, 28, 0.10);
--ink-whisper:   rgba(35, 32, 28, 0.05);
```

## Easing

```css
--ease-swift: cubic-bezier(.23, .88, .26, .92);
```

All transitions use `--ease-swift` unless stated otherwise. This is the single easing curve for the entire site.

Background is ALWAYS `--surface`. Never shifts on any page. Project accent colors exist only in:
- The waveform line color (on hover/scroll proximity)
- The margin hover image

Project accent colors:
- Gyeol: `#8B7355` (warm amber — intentionally distinct from ink base `#23201c`)
- Sift: `#CF957B` (terra cotta)
- Promptineer: none (unstable/WIP)
- Clouds at Sea: `#8BA4B8` (oceanic blue-gray)

## Typography

| Role | Font | Usage |
|------|------|-------|
| Primary | Fragment Mono | Project titles, ghost letters, numbers, nav, labels, ALL structural text |
| Accent | Newsreader (variable, italic) | Philosophy statement, case study paradox lines ONLY — the warm breath |
| Body | General Sans (variable) | Descriptions, paragraphs, body copy |

Fragment Mono at scale is the neo-brutalist signature. Monospace at 40vw is architecture. Newsreader appears rarely — when it does, it's an event.

| Element | Size | Weight | Details |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| Ghost HKJ letters | `clamp(240px, 40vw, 480px)` | 400 | Fragment Mono, `--ink-ghost` (0.10), parallax |
| Philosophy statement | `clamp(22px, 3vw, 32px)` | 400 | Newsreader italic, `--ink-primary` — the ONE warm moment |
| Project title | `clamp(28px, 3.5vw, 40px)` | 400 | Fragment Mono, `--ink-primary` |
| Case study paradox | `clamp(20px, 2.5vw, 28px)` | 400 | Newsreader italic, `--ink-primary` — the other warm moment |
| Body text | 15px | 400 | General Sans, `--ink-secondary`, max 54ch |
| Project description | 15px | 400 | General Sans, `--ink-secondary`, max 42ch |
| Nav links | 11px | 400 | Fragment Mono, uppercase, 0.06em tracking |
| Section labels | 11px | 400 | Fragment Mono, uppercase, 0.06em tracking, `--ink-muted` |
| Metadata | 11px | 400 | Fragment Mono, 0.04em tracking, `--ink-muted` |
| Ghost numbers | `clamp(120px, 15vw, 200px)` | 400 | Fragment Mono, `--ink-whisper` (0.05) |
| Project numbers (chrome) | 11px | 400 | Fragment Mono, chrome gradient (see Chrome section) |
| Clock | 11px | 400 | Fragment Mono, tabular-nums, `--ink-muted` |
| Colophon | 11px | 400 | Fragment Mono, `--ink-ghost` |

**Minimum type size: 11px.** Nothing smaller. Brutalism is raw, not illegible. At `--ink-muted` (0.35) and below, 11px Fragment Mono needs 0.06em tracking to remain legible on standard displays. Ghost numbers and ghost letters are exempt (they're spatial architecture, not meant to be read).

Typography rules:
- `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility` on body
- `font-feature-settings: "kern" 1, "liga" 1` on Newsreader (accent)
- `font-feature-settings: "tnum" 1` on Fragment Mono
- `letter-spacing: -0.01em` on General Sans body
- `letter-spacing: 0.06em` on Fragment Mono labels
- `letter-spacing: 0.02em` on Fragment Mono at display scale (titles, ghost letters)
- Never bold. Hierarchy through opacity and size only.

---

## Chrome Accent

One material-specific detail: project numbers (`01`, `02`, `03`, `04`) in the work sequence use a subtle chrome gradient on the text, creating a brushed-metal sheen:

```css
.chrome-text {
  background: linear-gradient(
    135deg,
    var(--ink-muted) 0%,
    var(--ink-ghost) 30%,
    var(--ink-secondary) 50%,
    var(--ink-ghost) 70%,
    var(--ink-muted) 100%
  );
  background-size: 200% 200%;
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
  background-clip: text;
}
```

The gradient position shifts with scroll (`background-position` linked to scroll Y), creating a subtle light-catching effect as you scroll past each number. Like brushed aluminum rotating under a light source. This is the ONE material flourish in an otherwise flat design.

Applied to: project numbers in the work sequence and case study metadata bar number only. Nothing else.

### First Viewport — The Opening Measure

Full-viewport composition. Three elements at extreme scale contrast:

**1. Ghost HKJ letterforms**
- Fragment Mono, `clamp(240px, 40vw, 480px)`
- Positioned in the lower-left quadrant
- The H's left stroke cropped by viewport edge by ~15%
- Color: `--ink-ghost` (0.10)
- On scroll: parallax upward at 0.3x scroll speed, fading to `--ink-whisper` (0.03)
- These letters are spatial architecture, not a logo placement

**2. Waveform line**
- `<canvas>` element, `position: fixed`, full viewport width
- Vertical position: ~60vh
- At rest: single sine wave, amplitude 8px, slow oscillation (~0.3Hz) — visible, not subtle
- Color: `--ink-ghost` at rest (0.10 — present on the surface, not hiding)
- Responds to cursor proximity: amplitude increases within 200px radius of pointer
- Responds to scroll: color and frequency shift based on nearest project zone
- Persists across all pages (fixed position, never removed)
- Line weight: 1px
- Rendering: `requestAnimationFrame`, anti-aliased via canvas lineWidth + half-pixel offset

**3. Nav coordinates**
- Fixed position, top-right: `padding: 20px clamp(24px, 5vw, 64px)`
- Content: `WORK   ABOUT   10:47 PM EST`
- Fragment Mono, 11px, uppercase, `--ink-muted`
- No container, no background, no border. Floating text.
- On case study pages: project title appears left of nav links in `--ink-ghost`

**4. Colophon**
- `position: absolute` (scrolls away with first viewport — not persistent). Bottom-right: `padding: 20px clamp(24px, 5vw, 64px)`
- Content: `DESIGN ENGINEERING · NEW YORK · 2026`
- Fragment Mono, 9px, `--ink-ghost`

### Work Sequence — Below the Fold

Content column: max-width 900px, margin-left ~8vw (left-shifted, not centered). The right margin is active negative space.

**Structural line:** A vertical 1px line in `--ink-whisper` runs the full height of the page at the content column's left edge. This is a bleed mark — exposed structure. It anchors the grid visually and says "this layout is intentional."

No "SELECTED WORK" label. No section header. The work sequence begins as a continuation of the first viewport's composition.

**Each project follows one structure:**

```
[ghost number, ~200px, --ink-whisper, behind title]

[number] ...................... [SECTOR · YEAR]    ← Fragment Mono, 10px (number has chrome gradient)
[Title]                                            ← Fragment Mono, clamp(28-40px)
[One-sentence description, max 42ch]               ← General Sans, 15px, --ink-secondary
──────────────────────────────────────────────────  ← 1px rule, --ink-ghost (visible, not hidden)
```

Number and metadata sit on the same baseline, left and right respectively. Title below. Description below that. Rule below that.

Spacing between projects: uniform `clamp(48px, 8vh, 72px)`. Consistent rhythm — the content creates variation, not the spacing.

**Hover behavior — inverted dimming + margin image:**

On hover of any project block:
1. All OTHER projects shift to `--ink-whisper` (0.05) — instant, no transition. Nearly invisible. Brutalist focus.
2. Hovered project stays at full `--ink-primary`.
3. In the right margin (the negative space), a project image fades in at fixed position, right-aligned to viewport edge. 500ms fade, 85% opacity. Grain overlay (feTurbulence, 0.03). This is a figure plate — editorial convention.
4. The fixed waveform line shifts color to the project's accent over 400ms.
5. Waveform frequency character adjusts: tighter for technical projects, slower for generative.

On hover-out: image fades (300ms), all projects return to full ink, waveform returns to `--ink-ghost`.

**Project-specific waveform behaviors:**
- Gyeol: warm amber tint, medium-high frequency, moderate amplitude
- Sift: terra cotta tint, tight high frequency, low amplitude
- Promptineer: no color shift, waveform becomes irregular/noisy (unstable — WIP)
- Clouds at Sea: oceanic blue-gray, slow deep oscillation, high amplitude

**Scroll-linked waveform (when not hovering):**
As each project enters the viewport center, the waveform color and character transitions to match that project. Creates a "radio dial" feeling — scrolling tunes through frequencies.

**Ghost numbers:**
Each project has a ~200px Fragment Mono number (`01`, `02`, `03`, `04`) positioned behind the title text at `--ink-whisper` (0.05). These are not labels — they're spatial architecture, like watermarks on paper. They create a sense of index and sequence without being "read."

### Footer

Not a traditional footer. After the last project, `clamp(100px, 15vh, 180px)` of empty space, then:

```
hyeonjunjun07@gmail.com         LINKEDIN  GITHUB  TWITTER
```

Fragment Mono, 10px. Email at `--ink-secondary`, social links at `--ink-muted`. Single line. Below: `© 2026 HKJ Studio` in Fragment Mono, 9px, `--ink-ghost`.

Then `72px` of surface. The page ends with emptiness. The composition breathes out.

---

## Page 2: Case Study (`/work/[slug]`)

### Transition

Current page fades to surface color (300ms). Waveform shifts to project accent color during the gap. New page content blur-reveals (500ms): `opacity:0, y:32, filter:blur(3px)` → clear.

The waveform stays fixed throughout — it's the thread connecting all pages.

### Layout

Same left-shifted column (max-width 900px, margin-left ~8vw). Same grid. Same typography system. Consistency across pages = the magazine has one grid.

### Structure

**1. Metadata bar** (top, after 96px padding for nav clearance)
```
01 / GYEOL: 결 / 2026 / MATERIAL SCIENCE
```
Fragment Mono, 10px, uppercase, `--ink-muted`, 0.06em tracking.

**2. Silence** — 72px of empty space. Let the metadata sit alone.

**3. Paradox line** (the editorial lede)
Newsreader italic, `clamp(20px, 2.5vw, 28px)`, `--ink-primary`, max 54ch.
> *Can a screen ever truly feel like a physical surface?*

One question. Large. Italic. The reader sits with it.

**4. Stakes paragraph** — 48px below paradox.
General Sans, 15px, `--ink-secondary`, max 54ch. 2-3 sentences. Why this matters.

**5. Hero image** — full-bleed break.
The image extends from the content column's left edge to the RIGHT viewport edge. It breaks the column intentionally — the editorial "bleed." Grain overlay. Blur-reveal on scroll-enter (GSAP ScrollTrigger, threshold 85%, once: true).

**6. Body sections** — modular block vocabulary, not a prescribed sequence.

Each block follows one pattern:
```
SECTION LABEL                    ← Fragment Mono, 10px, uppercase, --ink-muted
                                 ← 24px gap
Body copy. Max 54ch. 15px.       ← General Sans, --ink-secondary
                                 ← 64px gap before next block
```

Available block types (each project uses only what serves it):
- **Text block:** label + body copy (editorial overview, process description)
- **Steps block:** numbered steps (`01`-`04`, Fragment Mono numbers + title + copy)
- **Highlights block:** title + description + challenge in Newsreader italic
- **Signals block:** engineering copy + signal tags (1px `--ink-ghost` borders)
- **Stats block:** large mono numbers ~24px + tiny labels below, flex row
- **Media block:** image or video (bleeds right — see below)

Per-project block selection defined in case study data. Gyeol might use: text → steps → highlights → signals → media. Sift might use: text → text → highlights → stats. The vocabulary is fixed; the sequence is per-project. Editorial, not template.

**7. Media breaks** — images and videos break the column grid same as hero (bleed to right viewport edge). These are the only spatial deviations. Scroll-triggered blur-reveal. Video captions in Fragment Mono, 9px, `--ink-ghost`.

**8. Next project**
```
────────────────────────────────────────────
NEXT
[Title]                         [SECTOR · YEAR]
────────────────────────────────────────────
```
Same structure as a homepage project row. Clicking triggers page-fade transition.

---

## Page 3: About (`/about`)

Same grid. Same column. The quietest page.

**1. Philosophy statement** — same as homepage. Newsreader italic, `clamp(22px, 3vw, 32px)`. Intentional repetition — like an epigraph.

**2. Body** — two paragraphs. General Sans, 15px, `--ink-secondary`, max 54ch.

**3. Experience** — section label + timeline:
```
EXPERIENCE

2024 —              Independent, Design Engineering
2023 — 24           Design Technologist
2021 — 23           Frontend Developer
```
Fragment Mono for periods (10px, tabular-nums, `--ink-muted`). General Sans for roles (15px, `--ink-primary`). Separated by `--ink-whisper` rules.

**4. Contact** — not styled differently from body text.
"For work inquiries, reach me at hyeonjunjun07@gmail.com" — General Sans, 15px.
Social links as a single line of Fragment Mono, 10px, uppercase.

No images. No interactions beyond the ambient waveform. Restraint proves confidence.

---

## The Waveform — Technical Spec

The single interactive element. A `<canvas>` with `position: fixed`, `z-index: 1`, `pointer-events: none`.

### Rendering

- Canvas: full viewport width, ~120px height (centered on the line)
- Line: single path, 1px stroke, anti-aliased
- Draw function: sine wave with variable frequency, amplitude, and phase
- Update: `requestAnimationFrame`, ~60fps
- Smoothing: values lerp toward targets (never snap), `lerp(current, target, 0.04)`

### Parameters

| Parameter | Rest State | On Hover | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| amplitude | 8px | varies per project | Base wave height — visible at rest |
| frequency | 0.003 | varies per project | Wave tightness |
| speed | 0.0008 | 0.0008 | Phase advance per frame |
| color | `--ink-ghost` | project accent | Stroke color |
| cursorInfluence | 200px radius | 200px radius | Amplitude boost near pointer |
| cursorAmplitude | +20px at center | +20px at center | Extra amplitude from cursor proximity — responds with conviction |

### Scroll-linked behavior

Each project occupies a "zone" defined by its DOM position. As the viewport center crosses into a project's zone:
- `targetColor` lerps toward that project's accent
- `targetFrequency` lerps toward that project's frequency value
- Transition feel: smooth radio-dial tuning, not discrete switching

### Project frequency map

| Project | Frequency | Amplitude | Character |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Gyeol | 0.004 | 6px | Medium-high freq, moderate amp — warm, textured |
| Sift | 0.006 | 3px | Tight freq, low amp — precise, digital |
| Promptineer | noise mode | 4px | Irregular, freq randomized per frame — unstable |
| Clouds at Sea | 0.002 | 10px | Slow freq, high amp — oceanic, breathing |

### Cursor interaction

When the cursor is within 200px of the waveform's y-position:
- Local amplitude increases based on distance: `extra = 20 * (1 - distance/200)`
- Applied as a gaussian bump centered on cursor x-position, width ~150px
- Creates a "pluck" effect — like touching a string

### Reduced motion

If `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`:
- Waveform draws as a static horizontal line at `--ink-ghost`
- No animation, no cursor response
- Color still shifts on hover (instant, no lerp)
- All blur-reveal entrance animations disabled — content visible immediately
- Page transitions: instant swap, no fade/blur
- Entrance choreography: skipped entirely
- Hover dimming: still works (already instant)

---

## Animation Presets

All reveals use blur as the primary primitive. Content comes into focus, not slides into position.

| Context | From | To | Duration | Stagger |
|---------|------|----|----------|---------|
| First viewport elements | `opacity:0, y:40, blur:4px` | clear | 600ms | 80ms |
| Nav coordinates | `opacity:0, y:10, blur:2px` | clear | 500ms | 60ms |
| Project rows | `opacity:0, y:40, blur:4px` | clear | 600ms | 100ms |
| Case study sections | `opacity:0, y:32, blur:3px` | clear | 500ms | 60ms |
| Metadata | `opacity:0, y:8, blur:1px` | clear | 400ms | 40ms |
| Page exit | clear | `opacity:0` to paper | 300ms | — |
| Page enter | blur:3px, y:32 | clear | 500ms | 60ms |
| Margin image in | `opacity:0` | `opacity:0.85` | 500ms | — |
| Margin image out | `opacity:0.85` | `opacity:0` | 300ms | — |
| Hover dimming | `--ink-primary` | `--ink-whisper` | instant | — |

Two tempos only:
- **Immediate** (0-200ms): hover states, dimming, cursor response
- **Considered** (400-600ms): page transitions, scroll reveals, image fades

No middle ground. The gap is intentional.

### Entrance choreography (no preloader)

1. Waveform appears first — draws from left to right over 800ms (a line being drawn)
2. Nav coordinates blur-reveal (500ms, 60ms stagger)
3. Ghost HKJ letters fade from 0 to 0.10 over 600ms
4. Colophon reveals (400ms)
5. Below-fold project rows: scroll-triggered, 100ms stagger

Repeat visits (sessionStorage flag): quick 300ms fade-in, no choreography.

---

## Responsive

### Mobile (< 768px)

- Ghost HKJ letters: scale to `50vw`, maintain lower-left position
- Content column: full-width with `24px` inline padding. No left-shift.
- Project titles: `clamp(24px, 6vw, 32px)`
- Ghost numbers: hidden on mobile (they need desktop-scale space to work)
- Margin hover images: disabled (no hover on touch). Instead, project images display inline below description at 100% width.
- Waveform: still present, amplitude reduced. No cursor interaction (no hover). Scroll-linked color only.
- Nav: same position, same size. Clock hidden on mobile.
- Case study bleed images: full-width (no bleed needed, already edge-to-edge)
- Mobile spacing scale: 72px→48px, 48px→32px, 32px→24px, 24px→16px (specific values, not percentage)

### Tablet (768px - 1024px)

- Left-shift reduced to ~4vw
- Margin images: smaller (200px wide, aspect ratio preserved from source image)
- Ghost letters: `30vw`

---

## Margin Image Spec

- Position: `position: fixed`, right-aligned to viewport edge with `24px` right padding
- Vertical position: centered vertically in viewport (`top: 50%, transform: translateY(-50%)`)
- Width: `280px` on desktop, `200px` on tablet. Hidden on mobile.
- Height: auto (preserve source aspect ratio)
- Grain overlay: SVG feTurbulence, `opacity: 0.03`, overlaid via pseudo-element
- Image source: `piece.image` or `piece.coverArt` field — first available
- For projects without images (Promptineer): no margin image appears on hover
- z-index: 5 (above content, below nav)

---

## Scroll Zone Boundaries

Each project's "zone" for scroll-linked waveform color is defined by:
- Zone start: the project element's `offsetTop - (viewport height / 2)`
- Zone end: the next project's `offsetTop - (viewport height / 2)`, or `document.scrollHeight` for the last project
- When viewport center is between zone start and zone end, the waveform lerps toward that project's color and frequency
- Between zones: linear interpolation between adjacent project parameters for smooth transitions
- Recalculated on resize (debounced, 150ms)

---

## Routes

```
/                  Homepage (opening measure + work sequence + footer)
/work/[slug]       Case study (editorial detail page)
/about             Studio info (the quiet page)
```

---

## Technical Stack

```
Next.js 16 (App Router)
TypeScript (strict)
Tailwind CSS v4
GSAP (ScrollTrigger for scroll-linked reveals)
Framer Motion (hover states, AnimatePresence for margin images)
Canvas API (waveform — no WebGL, no Three.js)
Lenis (smooth scroll)
Zustand (minimal: hoveredSlug only)
```

No Three.js. No WebGL. No heavy dependencies. The craft is in the composition, not the tech stack.

### Performance Budget

The main thread carries: GSAP ScrollTrigger (intersection calculations), Canvas waveform (60fps lerp loop), Framer Motion (hover states). These must not compete.

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| LCP | < 2.0s |
| CLS | < 0.05 |
| INP | < 100ms |
| Lighthouse | 90+ |
| Initial JS | < 150KB gzipped |
| Waveform frame budget | < 4ms per frame (leaves 12ms for browser) |
| Scroll handler budget | < 2ms per frame |

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Waveform canvas runs on its own `requestAnimationFrame` loop, decoupled from GSAP/FM
- GSAP ScrollTrigger uses `will-change: transform` on parallax elements, `will-change: opacity` on reveal elements — set during animation, removed after
- Scroll zone calculations are cached and only recomputed on resize
- Canvas uses `OffscreenCanvas` if supported, falling back to main-thread canvas
- Margin images use `loading="lazy"` and `sizes` attribute for responsive loading
- Waveform reduces to 30fps on battery saver / low-power devices via `navigator.getBattery()` check

### Blur-Reveal Fallback Strategy

CSS `filter: blur()` is GPU-accelerated on desktop but expensive on mobile (triggers main-thread compositing on some devices).

**Approach:**
1. Desktop: use full blur-reveal preset (`opacity + y + blur`)
2. Mobile (< 768px): replace blur with opacity + slight scale mask: `opacity:0, y:16, scale:0.98` → clear. Same timing, no blur. Visually similar, dramatically cheaper.
3. Detection: media query `@media (hover: none)` as proxy for mobile, or check `navigator.hardwareConcurrency < 4`
4. If any jank is detected on first entrance animation, store flag in sessionStorage and skip blur for remaining session

### Animation library boundaries

- **GSAP** owns: scroll-triggered reveals (ScrollTrigger), entrance choreography sequencing, waveform draw-in animation, parallax (ghost letters)
- **Framer Motion** owns: hover state transitions (AnimatePresence for margin images), layout animations if needed
- **CSS transitions** own: color changes (hover dimming, link hover states) — these are instant or use `transition` property with `--ease-swift`
- **Canvas API** owns: waveform rendering (requestAnimationFrame loop, independent of GSAP/FM)
- **Rule:** GSAP and Framer Motion never animate the same element. If an element needs both scroll-triggered entry AND hover animation, GSAP handles entry, then hands off to CSS/FM for hover.

### Page transition mechanism

Page transitions use a shared layout wrapper in `layout.tsx` that:
1. Listens for route changes via `usePathname()`
2. On route change: applies exit animation to `<main>` content (opacity → 0, 300ms)
3. After exit completes: React renders new page content
4. Applies enter animation (opacity: 0, y: 32, blur: 3px → clear, 500ms)
5. The waveform canvas and nav coordinates live OUTSIDE `<main>` in the layout, so they persist without re-rendering across routes
6. Implementation: a `PageTransition` wrapper component using Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence` with `mode="wait"`

### Loading states

During route transitions, the surface background is always visible. No skeleton, no spinner. The 300ms exit + 500ms enter creates an 800ms total transition where the page is "breathing" — content fades out, surface holds, content fades in. The waveform's continuous animation provides visual continuity.

## Data Model

```typescript
interface Piece {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  type: "project" | "experiment";
  order: number;
  number: string;            // "01", "02", etc.
  sector: string;            // "Material Science", "Mobile / AI"
  description: string;       // One sentence, max ~42 words
  accent: string;            // Hex color for waveform tint
  frequency: number;         // Waveform frequency value (0.002-0.006)
  amplitude: number;         // Waveform amplitude in px (3-10)
  waveMode: "sine" | "noise"; // "noise" for WIP/unstable projects
  status: "shipped" | "wip";
  year: number;
  image?: string;            // Used for margin image + case study hero
  coverArt?: string;         // Fallback for margin image
  video?: string;            // Used in case study media section
  tags: string[];
}
```

The `accent`, `frequency`, `amplitude`, and `waveMode` fields are the resonance signature — each project's unique frequency identity.

## Imagery Direction

The surface is a controlled environment — cold mineral, monospace structure, strict ink hierarchy. Images are the ONE place where warmth, color, and texture enter. They must be treated as precious intrusions, not decorative fills.

### Image Treatment Rules

1. **Desaturated by default.** All images receive a CSS treatment: `filter: saturate(0.7) contrast(1.05)`. This pulls them toward the mineral surface tone without going full grayscale. Color is present but suppressed — the image lives IN the surface, not ON it.

2. **Grain overlay on everything.** Every image gets the feTurbulence grain at 0.03 opacity. This is the material texture that ties images to the surface. Without it, images feel pasted on.

3. **No borders, no shadows, no radius.** Images bleed directly into the surface or into each other. Borders would be decorative. The image's own content edge IS the boundary. Raw.

4. **Aspect ratio is content-driven.** No forced crops to fit a grid. If Gyeol's hero is 16:9, it's 16:9. If Sift's is 4:3, it's 4:3. The column/bleed system accommodates any ratio.

5. **The margin hover image is a window, not a preview.** It appears in negative space at 85% opacity — translucent, like seeing through a layer. It doesn't demand attention; it rewards curiosity. On hover-out, it dissolves back into the surface.

### Per-Project Image Personality

- **Gyeol:** Warm amber tones, material textures (hanji paper, ceramic, grain). The images should feel tactile — surfaces you want to touch. These are the warmest images on the site, creating the starkest contrast against the cold surface.
- **Sift:** Clean, geometric, muted terra cotta. UI screenshots treated with the desaturation filter to feel like documentation, not marketing. Clinical warmth.
- **Promptineer:** No images (WIP). The absence IS the visual. The project exists only as text and an unstable waveform.
- **Clouds at Sea:** Video only. Dark, atmospheric, oceanic. The video strip is the most visually immersive moment on the homepage — full-width, edge-to-edge, no grain overlay on video (grain + video compression artifacts = noise).

### Case Study Media

Inside case studies, images and videos follow the same rules. They bleed to the right viewport edge (breaking the column) and use scroll-triggered opacity reveals — no blur on images to avoid filter stacking with the desaturation.

Video clips autoplay muted, looped, `playsInline`. Captions in Fragment Mono 11px, `--ink-ghost`. Videos are the highest-fidelity moment in the case study — they should feel like looking through a window into the actual project.

## Verification

- Homepage: ghost HKJ letters visible, waveform breathing, projects in left-shifted column
- Hover any project: others fade to ghost, margin image appears, waveform shifts color
- Scroll through projects: waveform color transitions between project accents
- Click project: page fades to paper, case study blur-reveals, waveform maintains color
- Case study: metadata bar, paradox lede, body sections, bleed images, next project link
- About: quiet page, all type, no images
- Mobile: inline images, no ghost numbers, full-width column, waveform present
- Reduced motion: static waveform line, no blur reveals, instant transitions
- First visit entrance: waveform draws, then content reveals in sequence
- Repeat visit: quick fade-in, no choreography
